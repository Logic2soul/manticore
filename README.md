# Manticore

[![Build Status](https://semaphoreci.com/api/v1/projects/3ee7d6de-333a-4b15-afbc-065e3825778b/1298917/badge.svg)](https://semaphoreci.com/manticore/manticore)

Manticore is an experimental OS for edge computing that has the following, sometimes conflicting, goals:

* **Security** - The OS provides a foundation for secure computing. It's critical that the OS leverages hardware protection capabilities, provides minimal and safe system call interface to minimize attack surface, and is itself implemented in high-level language to minimize exploitable bugs.
* **Low latency** - One of the main motivations of edge computing is to provide lower latency than an equivalent cloud-based service would have. It's important that the OS itself has low overheads and provides interfaces that support low-latency applications.
* **Energy efficiency** - Communications technology is forecast to consume around 20% of global electricity by 2030, or as much as 50% in the worst case (Andrae and Edler, 2015)! It's therefore important that the OS provides interfaces that enable energy efficient computing.

## Getting Started

First, install Rust toolchain installer, [`rustup`](https://rustup.rs/).

Then, install the toolchain:

```
./scripts/install-toolchain
```

Finally, install `xargo`:

```
cargo install xargo
```

and `xorriso`:

```
dnf install xorriso
```

After all prerequisites are installed, you can build Manticore with:

```
make
```

The command builds a bootable `kernel.iso` image.

To launch the image under a VM, run the following command:

```
$ ./scripts/run kernel.iso
```

### Cross Compiling to AArch64

You can install the AArch64 cross compiling toolchain with:

```
./scripts/install-aarch64-toolchain
```

To build an AArch64 kernel image, use:

```
make ARCH=aarch64
```

To run the AArch64 kernel image under QEMU:

```
./scripts/run-aarch64
```
